# Budget Tracker

## Description

This app was developed so that the user would be able to subtract or add money from their budget and those transactions would appear and be graphed both online and offline. For this application I utilized IndexedDB, a manifest.webmanifest file and service workers.

## Usage

You can enter information about your transactions offline.</br>
![offline](public/images/offline.png)</br>
You can see those changes offline.</br>
![online entered](public/images/offline-entered.png)</br>
And when the internet is turned back on those changes will be saved to the database.</br>
